Much like machine learning libraries have done for prediction, DoWhy is a Python library that aims to spark
causal thinking and analysis. DoWhy provides a wide variety of algorithms for effect estimation, causal
structure learning, diagnosis of causal structures, root cause analysis, interventions and counterfactuals.
