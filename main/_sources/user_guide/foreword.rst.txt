The need for causal inference
----------------------------------

Predictive models uncover patterns that connect the inputs and outcome in observed data. To intervene, however, we need to estimate the effect of changing an input from its current value, for which no data exists. Such questions, involving estimating a *counterfactual*, are common in decision-making scenarios.

* Will it work?
    * Does a proposed change to a system improve people's outcomes?
* Why did it work?
    * What led to a change in a system's outcome?
* What should we do?
    * What changes to a system are likely to improve outcomes for people?
* What are the overall effects?
    * How does the system interact with human behavior?
    * What is the effect of a system's recommendations on people's activity?

Answering these questions requires causal reasoning. While many methods exist
for causal inference, it is hard to compare their assumptions and robustness of results. DoWhy makes three contributions,

1. Provides a principled way of modeling a given problem as a causal graph so
   that all assumptions are explicit.
2. Provides a unified interface for many popular causal inference methods, combining the two major frameworks of graphical models and potential outcomes.
3. Automatically tests for the validity of assumptions if possible and assesses
   the robustness of the estimate to violations.

To see DoWhy in action, check out how it can be applied to estimate the effect
of a subscription or rewards program for customers [`Rewards notebook
<https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/main/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_example_effect_of_memberrewards_program.ipynb>`_] and for implementing and evaluating causal inference methods on benchmark datasets like the `Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/main/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_ihdp_data_example.ipynb>`_ dataset, `Infant Mortality (Twins) <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/main/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_twins_example.ipynb>`_ dataset, and the `Lalonde Jobs <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/main/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_lalonde_example.ipynb>`_ dataset.




* *Some of the [description in the documentation](https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/main):*

>Much like machine learning libraries have done for prediction, DoWhy is a Python library that aims to spark causal thinking and analysis. DoWhy provides a wide variety of algorithms for effect estimation, causal structure learning, diagnosis of causal structures, root cause analysis, interventions and counterfactuals.
* Some of the [GitHub description](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy):

>DoWhy is a Python library for causal inference that supports explicit modeling and testing of causal assumptions. DoWhy is based on a unified language for causal inference, combining causal graphical models and potential outcomes frameworks.
* Some of its [README](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy/blob/main/README.rst):

>As computing systems are more frequently and more actively intervening in societally critical domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, it is critical to correctly predict and understand the causal effects of these interventions. Without an A/B test, conventional machine learning methods, built on pattern recognition and correlational analyses, are insufficient for decision-making.
Much like machine learning libraries have done for prediction, "DoWhy" is a Python library that aims to spark causal thinking and analysis. DoWhy provides a principled four-step interface for causal inference that focuses on explicitly modeling causal assumptions and validating them as much as possible. The key feature of DoWhy is its state-of-the-art refutation API that can automatically test causal assumptions for any estimation method, thus making inference more robust and accessible to non-experts. DoWhy supports estimation of the average causal effect for backdoor, frontdoor, instrumental variable and other identification methods, and estimation of the conditional effect (CATE) through an integration with the EconML library.


*In general, it should create some motivation and excitement for why one would use this library and why itâ€™s needed.*
