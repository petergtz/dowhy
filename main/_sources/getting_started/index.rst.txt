DoWhy is based on a simple unifying language for causal inference, unifying two powerful frameworks,
graphical causal models and potential outcomes. It uses graph-based criteria and do-calculus for modeling assumptions
and identifying a non-parametric causal effect.

For estimation, it switches to methods based primarily on potential outcomes and the best place to learn more about
this is the user guide's :doc:`../user_guide/effect_inference/index` chapter. Alternatively, learn about its basic
features in :doc:`../example_notebooks/dowhy_simple_example`.

For root cause analysis features and structural analysis it uses graphical causal models and we recommend starting
with :doc:`../user_guide/gcm_based_inference/index` in the user guide or check out
:doc:`../example_notebooks/gcm_basic_example`.

Finally, there's further resources available:

  `Tutorial on Causal Inference and Counterfactual Reasoning <https://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/>`_ at the
  `ACM Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2018 conference <http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/>`_
- A video introduction to the four steps of causal inference and its implications for machine learning from
  Microsoft Research:
